# Maintain organization information

## Form an organization

To set up an organization in the `CYFS` system is to construct a `Group` object and publish it to the `MetaChain`, the method is no different from the construction and chaining of other objects. However, there are several requirements for the chaining of `Group` objects:

1. There must be full signatures of all members (`Desc` and `Body`);
2. The initiator can be empty, otherwise it must be one of the administrators;
3. The `ObjectShellId` of the previous `Group` version must be empty;

In addition to using the same methods as other objects for `construction`, `signature`, and `chaining` in the program, support has also been added to the command line tool `desc-tool`.

-   Construct `Group` object

    For specific usage, directly enter `desc-tool create group -h` to view the help information as follows:

    ```
    >desc-tool create group -h

    USAGE:
        desc-tool.exe create group [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] --admins <admins> --area <area>

    FLAGS:
        -h, --help Prints help information
        -O, --org create a group as organization that administrators are changeable.
        -V, --version Prints version information

    OPTIONS:
        -A, --admins <admins> admins in group. format [PeopleId:title]
        -a, --area <area> Object area info. format [county:carrier:city:inner]
        -d, --description <description> description of group
        -F, --founder <founder> founder of group
        -I, --icon <icon> icon of group
            --idfile <id_file> write object id to file
        -M, --members <members> members in group. format [PeopleId:title]
        -n, --name <name> name of group
        -l, --oodlist <ood_list> oods in group
            --savepath <save_path> save file path
    ```

    For example, if we want to construct a `Group` containing 4 administrators, 2 ordinary members, and 4 OODs, all without `title`, we can use the following command:

    ```
    .\desc-tool.exe create group -F=5r4MYfFfTakY1h6vdEuMurpkawk4MZpB5RmY9CFqSj99 -A=5r4MYfFfTakY1h6vdEuMurpkawk4MZpB5RmY9CFqSj99:;5r4MYfFPPRDNNcJdvve4XV -M=5r4MYfF5r9cUfL -l=5aSixgN8tVt1SAM4xBfc1dYvdrU7d5fVeZrzNFpx8FiB;5aSixgMxgNu -n ="group" -I="icon" -d="description" -a=0:0:0:0 -O --savepath="./" --idfile="./group.id.txt"
    ```

    After the above command is executed, a `.desc` file named after the newly constructed `GroupId` will appear in the current working directory (specified by the `savepath` parameter), which is the encoded data of the newly constructed `Group`.

-   Distribute the constructed `Group` encoded data to each member in sequence, asking them to sign for confirmation:

```
.\desc-tool sign ${desc-path} -s=${signer-secret-path} -t=${signer-desc-path} -dba
```

-   Publish to `MetaChain`

```
>cyfs-meta-client.exe putdesc -h
create or update desc on meta, exclude userdata

USAGE:
     cyfs-meta-client.exe putdesc [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] --caller <caller> [ARGS]

FLAGS:
     -h, --help Prints help information
     -u force update body time on put
     -V, --version Prints version information

OPTIONS:
     -c, --caller <caller> desc and sec file path, exclude extension [default: C:\Users\Bucky\.cyfs\owner]
     -d, --desc <desc> desc file send to meta, default caller`s desc
     -m, --meta_target <meta_target> meta client target [default: dev]
     -v, --value <value> balance from caller to desc account when create [default: 0]

ARGS:
     <price> desc rent
     <coin_id> coin id
```

## Update organization information

The method of updating the organization is the same as other mutable objects, updating `Body` information, and then publishing to `MetaChain`, but updating `Group` has the following requirements:

1. All new members should sign the new `Group`;
2. The new `Group` must hold the full signatures of more than half of the administrators in the latest version of `Group` on the chain;
3. The new `Group` should clearly mark that it is only upgraded from the latest version on the current `MetaChain`, that is, its `prev_shell_id` field points to the `ObjectShellId` of the latest `Group`;
4. The version number of the new `Group` must be increased by 1 based on the version number of the latest `Group` on the current chain.

Similarly, we can use the `desc-tool` tool to complete the update operation:

```
>desc-tool modify -h

modify desc

USAGE:
     desc-tool modify [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <desc>

FLAGS:
         --appstart start app, default false
     -h, --help Prints help information

OPTIONS:
         --add_admin <add_admins> append administrators to group. format [PeopleId:title]
         --add_member <add_members> append members to group. format [PeopleId:title]
     -o, --add_ood <add_oods> device id append to people or group
     -A, --admins <admins> set administrators to group. format [PeopleId:title]
         --appid <app_id> app id add to app list
         --appver <app_ver> app ver add to app list
     -d, --description <description> description of group
     -e, --eps <eps> new endpoint list
     -I, --icon <icon> icon of people or group
     -m, --members <members> set members to group. format [PeopleId:title]
     -n, --name <name> name of people or group
     -l, --ood_lists <ood_lists> device id set to people or group
         --prev_shell <prev_shell_id> prev-shell-id of group
         --rm_admin <remove_admins> remove administrators from group. format [PeopleId]
         --rm_member <remove_members> remove members from group. format [PeopleId]
     -s, --sn <sn> new sn list
         --source <source> add source to app, {ver}:{id}
     -v, --version <version> version of group

ARGS:
     <desc> desc file to modify
```

Examples are as follows:

```
.\desc-tool modify 67fz8e9wt6Yqb9ex61tr2C1PwCqavBLFe153wfiVAhqQ.desc --add_admin=5r4MYfFBsQqy4r2LTccK1yyipRTtAjqvhX3GLU2qX3Lo --add_member=5r4MYfFapPzrXhfxWJNZJ f4pk5Ncfrx5ax2yumWKZrZj
.\desc-tool modify 67fz8e9wt6Yqb9ex61tr2C1PwCqavBLFe153wfiVAhqQ.desc --add_ood=5aSixgNLsF6r3qjDKP3XkBwnDRSr5G5hrGRM2v2LnLoA
.\desc-tool modify 67fz8e9wt6Yqb9ex61tr2C1PwCqavBLFe153wfiVAhqQ.desc --prev_shell=9cfBkPt2RPa3MofMmsAXpq8xHYn8A2xvVPuQiBT4XTp9 -v=2
```

The process of collecting signatures and uploading to the chain is the same as creating a `Group` and will not be repeated here.

## Save different versions of `Group` objects in `NON`

During the above update process, `Group` objects are stored in the file system. In `DecApp`, the update process of `Group` should be automated, so it is necessary to store different versions of `Group` objects in the `NON` system of each member, at least two versions of `Group` should be stored needs:

1. The latest version `Group` is the same as the latest version on the chain;
2. The `Group` which is being updated is collecting signatures from each member, and has not yet been released on the chain.

The `ObjectShell` core object is provided in `NON` of `CYFS`, and a shell is added to different versions of the object. The shell objects of different versions are all brand new objects. Their `ObjectId` is different, and they can coexist in the `NON` system .

For the statement about `ObjectShell`, see [issue 219](https://github.com/buckyos/CYFS/issues/219)

# Maintain shared data

We use the `Hotstuff` algorithm to allow `Group` members to jointly maintain shared data. This section describes how to implement it in `DecApp`.

## Role

1. Ordinary users can only operate through `Group` member agents, and their behavior is completely defined by `DecApp` itself;
2. `Group` members, who can initiate proposals;
3. `Group` OOD, usually composed of `Group` administrators `OOD`, run server programs based on `Hotstuff` to maintain consistency on these `OOD`, they are responsible for collecting proposals initiated by `Group` members, and execute.

## Initiate a proposal

Initiating proposals is the process of `Group` members.

1. Open the protocol stack

```rust
let stack = SharedCyfsStack::open_default(dec_id).await?;
stack.wait_online(None).await?;
```

2. Open `GroupManager`

```rust
let group_mgr = GroupManager::open_as_client(
         stack,
     ).await?;
```

3. Initiate a proposal

The method of initiating a proposal is the same as the cross-`Zone` request, using the `post_object` method of `NON`, and setting the `target` parameter to the corresponding `GroupId`. The following is an example code:

```rust
     // post proposal to the admins, it's same as calling to non. post_object with default parameters;
     // and you can call the non. post_object with more parameters.
     async fn post_proposal(
         &self,
         proposal: &GroupProposal,
     ) -> BuckyResult<Option<NONObjectInfo>> {
         let req_path = RequestGlobalStatePath::new(
             Some(proposal. rpath(). dec_id(). clone()),
             Some("group/proposal"),
         );
         self. stack
             .non_service()
             .post_object(NONPostObjectOutputRequest {
                 common: NONOutputRequestCommon {
                     req_path: Some(req_path. format_string()),
                     source: None,
                     dec_id: self.0.local_dec_id.clone(),
                     level: NONAPILevel::Router,
                     target: Some(proposal.rpath().group_id().clone()),
                     flags: 0,
                 },
                 object: NONObjectInfo::new(proposal.desc().object_id(), proposal.to_vec()?, None),
             })
             .await
             .map(|resp| resp.object)
     }
```

The above process is also customized in the `Group` module:

```
let client = group_mgr.rpath_client(group_id, dec_id, rpath).await;

let result_object = client.post_proposal(proposal).await; // The above sample code is the implementation code of `post_proposal`
```

## Start the service

Services are processes that run on `Group` `OOD`.

1. Open the protocol stack

```rust
let stack = SharedCyfsStack::open_default(dec_id).await?;
stack.wait_online(None).await?;
```

2. Open `GroupManager`

```rust
let group_mgr = GroupManager::open(
         stack,
         rpath_delegate_factory // DelegateFactory, construct and process `Delegate` corresponding to `rpath` request, handle(fn () -> Delegate)
     ).await?;
```

3. Start the service `RPathService`

```rust
     let service = group_mgr
         .start_rpath_service(
             group_id,
             rpath.to_string(),
             Box::new(MyRPathDelegate::new(
                 local_name.to_string(),
                 cyfs_stack. clone(),
                 dec_app_id.object_id().clone(),
             )),
         )
         .await
```

3. Listen to the `GroupProposal` object

-   Refer to the permission system, just ensure that you can receive `GroupProposal` objects from `Group` members;
-   Mount the `Handle` that listens to the `GroupProposal` object.

```rust
     //demo

     stack
         .root_state_meta_stub(None, None)
         .add_access(GlobalStatePathAccessItem::new(
             "group/proposal",
             AccessString::full().value(),
         ))
         .await;

     stack
         .router_handlers()
         .post_object()
         .add_handler(
             RouterHandlerChain::Handler,
             format!("group-proposal-listener-{}", dec_app_id).as_str(),
             0,
             Some(filter),
             Some(req_path),
             RouterHandlerAction::Pass,
             Some(Box::new(routine)),
         )
         .await;
```

4. Post `GroupProposal` to `RPathService`

```rust
let result = service.push_proposal(&proposal).await;
```

5. Implement the aforementioned `DelegateFactory`

```rust
     #[async_trait::async_trait]
     impl DelegateFactory for GroupRPathDelegateFactory {
         async fn create_rpath_delegate(
             &self,
             group_id: &ObjectId,
             rpath: &str,
             with_block: Option<&GroupConsensusBlock>,
             is_new: bool,
         ) -> BuckyResult<Box<dyn RPathDelegate>> {
             if self.is_accept(group_id, rpath, with_block) {
                 // If accepted, provide the processing response object for the rpath
                 // define your delegate
                 Ok(Box::new(RPathDelegate))
             } else {
                 Err(BuckyError::new(BuckyErrorCode::Reject, ""))
             }
         }
     }
```

6. Implement `RPathDelegate`

```rust
     #[async_trait::async_trait]
     impl RPathDelegate for MyRPathDelegate {
         async fn on_execute(
             &self,
             proposal: &GroupProposal,
             prev_state_id: &Option<cyfs_base::ObjectId>,
             object_map_processor: &dyn GroupObjectMapProcessor,
         ) -> BuckyResult<ExecuteResult> {
             // Execute `proposal` based on the current state `prev_state_id` and return the new state
         }

         async fn on_verify(
             &self,
             proposal: &GroupProposal,
             prev_state_id: &Option<cyfs_base::ObjectId>,
             execute_result: &ExecuteResult,
             object_map_processor: &dyn GroupObjectMapProcessor,
         ) -> BuckyResult<()> {
             // Check the correctness of the execution result of `proposal`, return Ok if it is correct, and return Err if it is wrong
         }

         async fn on_commited(
             &self,
             prev_state_id: &Option<cyfs_base::ObjectId>,
             block: &GroupConsensusBlock,
             object_map_processor: &dyn GroupObjectMapProcessor,
         ) {
             // The proposal has been submitted to the consensus chain and has been approved by `2f+1` `OOD` signatures, this is its final execution result
         }
     }
```

## Query the result

TODO: Any proposal execution will be synchronized to the `RootState` corresponding to `DecApp` of each member. We can access them through the interface of `RootState`, but the synchronization function of `ObjectMap` has not been completed yet, so we cannot provide support for the time being. The target query method is as follows:

```rust
     let query_state_stub = client_stack.root_state_accessor_stub(
         Some(group. desc(). object_id()),
         Some(*dec_app_id. object_id()),
     );

     let resp = query_state_stub
         .get_object_by_path(path)
         .await
         .unwrap();
```

But for the time being, the final calculation result can only be obtained from the aforementioned `RPathDelegate::on_commited`.

# Example

[group-example](https://github.com/buckyos/CYFS/tree/main/src/tests/group-example) implements the function of a `Group` to jointly maintain an integer.
