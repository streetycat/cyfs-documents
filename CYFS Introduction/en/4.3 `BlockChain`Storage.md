|           |--.dec-state-->ObjectId // for decï¼›the latest state of all groups
|           |   // one state of a r-path, It's calculated by the app, and it's a map-id in most times
|           |   // Each state change for same ${r-path} is serial
|           |   // Each state change for different ${r-path} is parallel
|           |   // **The process of state change for different ${r-path} should always not be nested, Because the change of each branch will affect the state of the root**
|           |--.link // Blockchain for hotstuff, record the state change chain,Most of the time, application developers do not need to pay attention

|               |   |--${user-id}

|               |--pre-commits // pre-commit blocks, with QC for the header block, and is QC by a prepare block
|               |   |--${block.id}

|               |   |--recycle-->Set<ObjectId>
|               |   |--adding-->Set<ObjectId>
```

And the cache storage in the DecAPP

```
|--${root} // config by the DecAPP
    |--${group-id}
        |--${r-path}
            |--state-->ObjectId // the latest state, will sync from `/.dec-state/${group-id}/${dec-id} /${r-path}/`
            |--header-block-->Block // the header block
            |--qc-->qc-block // the qc for the ${block}
```
